I can only speak for their happy hour, but it was probably one of the best happy hours around town! Everything was so cheap and great quality!

We were planning on hitting the Chuck box for dinner afterwards so we decided to try an appetizer off of the happy hour menu just to give it a try and munch on a snack until we finished our drinks. That did not happen. We were sooooo full from the pork nachos appetizer that we could not even think about eating anything else. When the waitress brought them out, we were in shock and I guess it happens all the time because she immediately said, \" I know, they're huge and the biggest thing you can get for $5 anywhere.\" (LOOK AT MY PICTURE OF IT) Not only was it humongous, it was incredibly delicious!!! They are extremely generous with all of the toppings (and boy, do they have a lot of toppings). We asked for hot sauce and she brought out sriracha. At first we were like, sriracha? That weird, but she walked away and I love sriracha so I was like I'll give it a try, why not? WOW it surprisingly went perfect with the pork and cheese etc. I can't wait to come back for happy hour again because everything on the menu looked amazing!! Our server was so kind and funny. She was very helpful and helped us choose the perfect meal for the day! I think her name was Christina. I definitely recommend trying their happy hour!!

I had a Chipoltle Margarita (for those of you who like it spicy. Literally! complete with a red hot pepper as the garnish.). After I drank 1/2 of it, I asked the bartender if he could 'tone it down' a bit, which he did gladly, and shook me up another full (milder) drink. Impressive.\n\nSeating was quick. Our waiter, Jay, was attentive, a bit snarky but knowledgeable and edgy. We liked him. We didn't want to order full meals, and were more interested in just drinks and a few appetizers. He recommended the Street Tacos and Chile Verde, which we now HIGHLY recommend! The food was beyond good.

We were looking for something a little nicer off University and Z'Tejas fit the bill perfectly.  My friend and I arrived and opted to sit at the bar.  \n\nDrinks / Appetizers:  The bartender was prompt and we were lucky enough to arrive at 6:59 and the happy hour closed at 7.  We ordered 2x of their special margaritas (the strong ones), the shrimp mini-tostadas and the tuna appetizer.  The drinks arrived promptly accompanied by the homemade cornbread (amazing) and were a fantastic mix of flavor and alcohol.  Normally with frozen margaritas they go too strong or not strong enough, these were perfect.  The sesame tuna sashimi was good as I would expect it to be, however the shrimp mini-tostadas were the star of the appetizers.  The pesto was fantastic and they went quickly.  \n\nMain Course:  We both ordered steak fajitas and they came out sizzling as they should.  I prefer a little harder char on the steak, but you couldn't deny the flavor.  They were good enough to feel confident about ordering them on a regular basis, however don't expect them to change redefine what you want in a fajita.  They were what you'd expect from a nice restaurant.    \n\nDesert:  We each started with a 3rd margarita each (which we later were told was the limit because it equates to a 1/2 bottle of alcohol) and ordered peach cobblers.  Be warned, these warm cobblers are ENORMOUS and unless you have an empty leg, or severe case of self loathing, I'd order it to share.  \n\nOverall thoughts / impression:  The restaurant was exactly what we were looking for when we walked in off University.  It was a nicer mid-tier restaurant experience in what is typically a collegey area of town (ASU is right down the street).  The Happy Hour is noteworthy in that drinks / appetizers were 1/2 off and if I make it back to Phoenix for work or fun I'd definitely attend again for that reason alone.", "useful": 1, "funny": 0, "cool": 0}

Well, it exists so you don't leave in the condition discussed above. It's not as good as the margaritas, but once you have a couple, you're really not going to care that much.\n\nBrunch is the best time to hit this place up and indulge in a three dollar mimosa, their three dollar top shelf do-it-yourself bloody mary bar (with all the fixins, including beef jerky stir sticks!), or the epic margaritas. The chicken and potato hash is decent, but it used to be much better back when it was the savory sage chicken and potato hash and had, how do you say, actual flavor. Now it's just blah by comparison. Well done blah. But blah all the same (although Mr. Man loves it). So you may want to hit up the smothered burrito or jerk chicken salad instead, both of which are delicious. \n\nHappy hour is also a pretty good deal, with one dollar off all drinks and half price appetizers. I'd recommend the Cast Iron Skillet Dumplings that are like crispy round Asian pot stickers that come out sizzlin' in sweet chile sauce or the Tortilla Soup, which is done really, really well here with avocado and lots of chunky chicken. \n\nBut forget the food.

It was one of my first dinners while I was in Phoenix for business.  The cornbread is yummy and the appetizer I had with shrimp with guacomole on a chip was amazing. \n\nCan't remember what I ordered though....so that's why I'm giving it 4 stars.  It must not have been that good that I didn't crave for it enough to go back.  I was in Phoenix for 3 loooooong weeks. \n\nThey have Valet which is nice and there wasn't a long wait...is there ever in the Phoenix area?????  \n\nLeena", "useful": 3, "funny": 0, "cool": 1}

But it's OK, it was just an appetizer sampler, we weren't expecting anything spectacular.  What was really awful was the service.  As we walked in we couldn't find anyone, except someone watching TV.  So we waited there for a minute or two and finally sat ourselves.  Turns out the our waiter was the guy watching TV.  Throughout the whole evening the guy maybe visited us maybe 4 times, we couldn't even get him to take our money (still glued to the TV) so we left cash and walked out.\n\n2nd trip:  We decided to give the place a second chance because for some reason we thought the place was under new management.  Service similarly bad, waiter checked in on us more often but it still took a really long time just for the guy to run my credit card (no cash on me this time).  We had two waiters, first one messed up our orders several times on simple things like drinks--which they fixed.  The worst aspect of this evening was the food, the pizza we ordered tasted like a frozen Digiorno pizza, and not the fancy kind that taste good.  I left the restaurant convinced that the place is a cover for some sort of illicit activity.\n\nJust to make things clear: I hate giving 1 star reviews.  I'm a local and I like supporting local businesses, and there are a LOT of good restaurants in this area.  This is not one of them.  Not even remotely.", "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0}

Taking over an hour to eat at a lunch time place is a no go.   Offering to refill two people's diet Pepsi and then switching the glasses is something we avoided on this particular trip, but has happened in the past.   Really only go here if you aren't on a schedule and don't mind fairly mediocre food.", "useful": 2, "funny": 2, "cool": 1}

It is a small place with a take-out area and a dining room. When you walk it, it smells incredible. I have yet to have something that tastes like the smell.\n\nI've had the Penne with meat sauce. The pasta was overcooked and the meat sauce was average. The lasagna is above average and threatens to be good, but doesn't quite make it.\n\nThe side salad is okay as far as such things go. It consists of mostly iceburg lettuce with a middle eastern type olive thrown in and a sprinkling of some kind of field green. The salad dressings I've tried are bottled.\n\nThere is a daily pasta special.", "useful": 1, "funny": 0, "cool": 0}

At work we routinely order 3-5 plates and we've never had a problem. Today I was inspired to yelp about Cafe Roma because I asked for eggplant instead of chicken on my chicken alfredo. Pretty much amazing. I had everyone I work with try it!\n\nThe pasta dishes are all very good, wraps are super tasty, subs are good, the calzones and strombolis are amazing, decent prices, clean and friendly atmosphere. Service has always been good for me, Ive eaten at the Cafe a 2-3 times, and I've had it delivered many times. \n\nTo wrap it up, I'd recommend eating here to anyone!", "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0}

The cazlones' cheese, sauce, and bread are all pretty good. They are huge and decently priced. One calzone could feed two non-starving people. I usually have to struggle to finish one. Other dishes are decent, but nothing to come back for. \n\nPRICE: A calzone and a drink cost about $9-10. \n\nATMOSPHERE: It's a typical low-cost Italian restaurant. TV's in the corners, music playing in the background, a couple decorations on the walls. Good place for lunch or modest dinner. \n\nSERVICE: Nice people, but they can be almost too helpful at times. Sometimes they come by the table four times during the meal to ask if everything is alright. Sometimes I want to shout, \"Yes! Everything is wonderful, now leave us alone!\" They know I get the calzone every time I go there, it's a cool feeling to have that regular status.\n\nSKINNY: Try the calzone, I think its pretty good. If it's not good, then I'm sorry I wasted all this time writing this review only to lead you astray.", "useful": 6, "funny": 3, "cool": 1}

It was a Wednesday night at about 8pm.  The place was dead.  All 15 or so tables were empty.  WTF.  We were there for over an hour and only like 3 people wandered in during our meal to pickup food and that was it.  I have no idea how this place stays in business.  Especially since it has been there for forever.\n\nAnyway, our waiter was very good/quick/friendly but I could tell he really didn't understand why we were there.  I'm guessing that the place is primarily a lunch place and a takeout place.  He got our orders right and my diet cokes were quickly refilled.\n\nTo start we ordered a bottle of wine.  We could tell from the waiter's reaction that this does not happen often.  All the bottles were like 20ish dollars so what the heck.\n\nHere is what we ordered:\n\n* House Salad = very good\n* Chicken Parm = good, big\n* Pizza = unexpectedly very good.  We ordered the white pizza with ricotta cheese..  I asked and our waiter said it was made fresh which was surprising.\n* Greek Salad = I didn't try this but it looked pretty good.  Not sure why but the waiter asked what kind of dressing they wanted on it.  I thought all Greek salads came with basically the same dressing.  Oh well....Italian dressing it is.\n\nI really don't want to knock a little local establishment.  The place is just ok.  Our waiter was good, the food was good, and the price was good.  It is one of the last places within walking distance of my house that I hadn't tried yet and I can now cross if off my list.  It wasn't horrible so of course I would go back but I certainly won't rush back.", "useful": 1, "funny": 0, "cool": 0}
